    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      StayEase began with a simple idea — travel should be easy, personal, and filled with discovery. 
      We wanted to build a platform where anyone could find a perfect place to stay, whether it’s a cozy cabin in the hills, 
      a beachside villa, or an urban apartment in the heart of the city.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to connect travelers with verified hosts while making booking and hosting simple, transparent, and enjoyable. 
      We aim to make every trip — short or long — comfortable, affordable, and memorable.
